My name is Dustin Bates. I am an aspiring software developer, currently working to complete my education at Boise CodeWorks. I have a passion for creative problem-solving that is boosted by my quick-learning and talent for analytical thinking and communication. 

After over 10 years of experience in the hardware side of tech, I found a new passion in the software side and am eager to persue it further. I know how all the insides of a computer work, now I want to know how it's "brain" works too! 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Vue.js, MongoDb, C#, MySQL
